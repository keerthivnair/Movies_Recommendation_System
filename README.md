My project helps in recommending movies based on your preferred genre and your past ratings of movies.
This recommendation system is also efficient enough to provide recommendations based on collaborative filtering (similar taste viewers) if you haven't been a watcher or given your rating before.
Uses gradient descent and mean normalization to make the predictions more accurate.
The project is entirely built from scratch using numpy, pd and matplotlib for visualizations.
More features ,optimizations to be added soon along with better model accuracy.
